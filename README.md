# AdventureWorks-SQL-Reporting-Project
Writing a series of SQL queries and creating reports based on the data retrieved.  Ranging from simple to more advanced queries, the goal was to create a deeper picture of a section of the Adventureworks database.  Once the queries were written, the results were put into reports using Microsoft report builder to display the data.
